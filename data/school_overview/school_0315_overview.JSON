Our school serves students in the general education setting as well as provides service for students requiring support services such as speech and language, social work services, occupational services and physical therapy services. Our mission is to, in concert with students, families, the broader community and the support of management and operations, prepare all students to be responsible citizens and afford them the opportunity to acquire the skills, knowledge and abilities necessary to make decisions that lead to meaningful and productive lives.",
