	"description": "Our goal at Truesdell Education Campus is for every child we serve to receive the character, education and academic development necessary to be successful in college, in their careers and in life. We start talking about college with our three-year-old preschool students. The educators in the building are extremely committed to helping children develop in all areas, with many volunteering to stay after school and on weekends to work with children. The staff truly goes above and beyond.",
