	"description": "Orr Elementary School is a DC3 Collaborative School located in Southeast DC. In addition to offering a high-quality core curriculum, our students also have the opportunity to participate in our arts program, library media center, music, computer, art and physical education classes. To supplement our rigorous academic curriculum, we offer a variety of extracurricular activities including our French Language and Culture Program through our partnership with the Alliance Francaise. Our partnership with the Boys and Girls Club of Greater Washington allows us to offer before and after care programs. We have a brand new, state-of-the-art library and  a parent center run by our full-time parent coordinator. At Orr, we strive to provide our students with a comprehensive, well-rounded education that prepares them not only for their future academic careers, but also to become productive citizens in the world.",
